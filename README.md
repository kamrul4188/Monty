# The Monty Project
The project below explains how to build a simple chat bot called Monty, adding functionality in small incremental steps.

## Monty 1

Write a Python program to read in one user command and repeat it back to the user. An example output is given below.

```
>>> Hello, my name is Monty
>>> What can I do for you?
foo
>>> Your command is: foo
>>> Bye!
```
## Monty 2
Extend **Monty 1** code to work as follows:

```
>>> Hello, my name is Monty
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Nothing to list
>>> What can I do for you?

foo
>>> OOPS! Unknown command
>>> What can I do for you?

exit
>>> Are you sure? y/n
n
>>> What can I do for you?

exit
>>> Are you sure? y/n
y
>>> Bye!
```

## Monty 3
Restructure the **Monty 2 code** to fit the following structure, while keeping the behavior same as **Monty 2**.

```python
import sys


# ADD MISSING METHODS


def main():
    print_greeting()
    while True:
        command = read_command()
        execute_command(command)


main()
```

## Monty 4
Enhance the **Monty 3 code** to improve the functionality as per the sample output given below.

```
>>> Hello, my name is Monty
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Nothing to list
>>> What can I do for you?

add read book
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> List of items:
     1. read book
>>> What can I do for you?

add return book
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> List of items:
     1. read book
     2. return book
>>> What can I do for you?

exit
>>> Are you sure? y/n
y
>>> Bye!
```

## Monty 5

Enhance the Monty 4 code in the following ways:

* Add a done command so that the user can mark a task as done. e.g., done 2 marks the task at index 2 as 'done'.
* Show appropriate error messages if the user gives an invalid index for the done command

A sample output is given below.

```
>>> Hello, my name is Monty
>>> What can I do for you?

add borrow book
>>> What can I do for you?

add read book
>>> What can I do for you?

add return book
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> List of items:
     [âœ—] 1. borrow book
     [âœ—] 2. read book
     [âœ—] 3. return book
>>> What can I do for you?

done 1
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> List of items:
     [âœ“] 1. borrow book
     [âœ—] 2. read book
     [âœ—] 3. return book
>>> What can I do for you?

done abc
>>> SORRY, I could not perform that command. Problem: abc is not a number
>>> What can I do for you?

done 5
>>> SORRY, I could not perform that command. Problem: No item at index 5
>>> What can I do for you?

done 0
>>> SORRY, I could not perform that command. Problem: Index must be greater than 0
>>> What can I do for you?

garbage
>>> SORRY, I could not perform that command. Problem: Command not recognized
>>> What can I do for you?

exit
>>> Are you sure? y/n
y
>>> Bye!
```


ðŸ’¡ Each task has two data values: the description and the 'done' status. You can use a list to hold these two data items. 
That means your list of tasks will be a list containing lists. Example:
```python
tasks = []
tasks.append(['read book', False])
print('Description of the first task:', tasks[0][0])

if tasks[0][1]:
    print('âœ“')
else:
    print('âœ—')
```
ðŸ’¡ You can use exceptions to identify and handle errors in the command.

```python
def main():
    print_greeting()
    while True:
        try:
            command = read_command()
            execute_command(command)
        except Exception as e:
            print('>>> SORRY, I could not perform that command. Problem:', e)
```
## Monty 6
Enhance the **Monty 5 code** in the following ways:

* Add a help command so that the user can view how to use the app.
* Improve the formatting of the text displayed to the user to make the user experience nicer.

A sample output is given below.
```

******************************************************************************************* 

>>> What can I do for you?

help
>>> I'm glad you asked. Here it is:
==================================================
Monty can understand the following commands:

  add DESCRIPTION 
    Adds a task to the list
    Example: add read book
  done INDEX
    Marks the task at INDEX as 'done'
    Example: done 1
  exit
    Exits the application
  help_info
    Shows the help_info information
  list
    Lists the tasks in the list
-------------------------------------------------- 

>>> What can I do for you?

add read book
>>> Task added to the list
>>> What can I do for you?

add return book
>>> Task added to the list
>>> What can I do for you?

done 1
>>> Congrats on completing a task! :-)
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Here is the list of tasks:
==================================================
STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                
--------------------------------------------------
  âœ“    |   1   | read book                  
  âœ—    |   2   | return book                
--------------------------------------------------
>>> What can I do for you?
```

## Monty 7
Enhance the **Monty 6 code** in the following ways:

* Monty saves tasks into a csv file.
* Add a delete command that can delete a task at a specific index.

A sample output is given below. Note the following:

* Monty is able to show at the very start the three tasks loaded from the file.
* When item 2 is deleted, the item previously at index 3 moves to position 2.

```

******************************************************************************************* 

>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Here is the list of tasks:
==================================================
STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                
--------------------------------------------------
  âœ“    |   1   | borrow book                
  âœ—    |   2   | read book                  
  âœ—    |   3   | return book                
--------------------------------------------------

STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                
--------------------------------------------------
  âœ“    |   1   | borrow book                
  âœ—    |   2   | return book                  
--------------------------------------------------
```
ðŸ’¡ here are some tips:

* The filename can be specified in the code. e.g.,
`DATA_FILE = monty_7.csv`
* The format of the file is up to you. Here is an example:

```
borrow book,done
read book,pending
return book,pending
```

* The program can load the tasks from the file at the beginning. It can save the data after each command. For example, as follows:

```python
items = []
DATA_FILE = 'monty7.csv'


def main():
     load_data(DATA_FILE) # load task data from the file
     print_greeting()
     while True:
         try:
             command = read_command()
             execute_command(command)
             save_data(DATA_FILE, items) # save all tasks in the file
         except Exception as e:
             print('>>> SORRY, I could not perform that command. Problem:', e)

main()
```

Given below are some more features you can consider adding at this point (it is optional to add them to Monty 7):

* Remove the the need for the user to confirm before exiting Monty. As data are saved to a file, such a confirmation is no 
longer necessary because an accidental exit will not cause any permanent damage.

```
>>> What can I do for you?

exit
>>> Bye!
```

* Add a `pending` command that can mark a task as pending (i.e., the opposite of the `done` command).

```
 >>> What can I do for you?
 
 list
 >>> Here is the list of tasks:
 ==================================================
 STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                
 --------------------------------------------------
   âœ“    |   1   | borrow book                
   âœ—    |   2   | read book                  
   âœ—    |   3   | return book                
 --------------------------------------------------
 >>> What can I do for you?
 
 pending 1
 >>> OK, I have marked that item as pending
 >>> What can I do for you?
 
 list
 >>> Here is the list of tasks:
 ==================================================
 STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                
 --------------------------------------------------
   âœ—    |   1   | borrow book                
   âœ—    |   2   | read book                  
   âœ—    |   3   | return book                
 --------------------------------------------------
 >>> What can I do for you?
```

* Make commands case insensitive and immune to extra leading/trailing spaces. For example, 
all these commands should work the same way.

```
add read book
ADD read book
Add read book
add    read book
    add read book
```

## Monty 8
Enhance the **Monty 7 code** to add support for keeping track of deadlines as well as regular todo tasks

Previous behavior:

* add buy book: adds a task buy book

Proposed change - replace the above command with the following two:

* todo read book: adds a todo task read book
* deadline return book by: May 3rd adds a deadline return book which is to be done by May 3d.
Note: by: is a keyword. Anything that comes after it is considered a description of the deadline.

A sample output is given below.
```
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Here is the list of tasks:
============================================================
STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                 | DEADLINE
------------------------------------------------------------
  âœ“    |   1   | borrow book                 | -
  âœ—    |   2   | read book                   | -
  âœ—    |   3   | return book                 | Monday
------------------------------------------------------------
>>> What can I do for you?

todo watch movie
>>> What can I do for you?

deadline submit assignment by: end of May
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Here is the list of tasks:
============================================================
STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                 | DEADLINE
------------------------------------------------------------
  âœ“    |   1   | borrow book                 | -
  âœ—    |   2   | read book                   | -
  âœ—    |   3   | return book                 | Monday
  âœ—    |   4   | watch movie                 | -
  âœ—    |   5   | submit assignment           | end of May
------------------------------------------------------------
>>> What can I do for you?
```

## Monty 9
Enhance the **Monty 8 code** to use classes `ToDo` and `Deadline` (i.e., you need to define these two classes) to represent todo tasks and deadlines, respectively.

## Monty 10
Enhance the Monty 9 code to extract the following classes:

* `UserInterface`: an object of this class can be used to handle reading input from the user and showing output back to the user.
* `StorageManager`: an object of this class can be used to read data from the data file and write data back to the data file.
* `TaskManager`: an object of this class will hold the list of Task/Deadline objects and will execute commands.

**Optional feature to consider:** add a progress command that shows how many tasks/deadlines were marked as done during a session so far. Here is an example output:
```
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Here is the list of tasks:
    ============================================================
    STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                 | DEADLINE
    ------------------------------------------------------------
      âœ“    |   1   | borrow book                 | -
      âœ—    |   2   | read book                   | -
      âœ—    |   3   | return book                 | Monday
    ------------------------------------------------------------
>>> What can I do for you?

progress
>>> Progress for this session: todos 0 deadlines 0
>>> What can I do for you?

done 2
>>> Congrats on completing a task! :-)
>>> What can I do for you?

progress
>>> Progress for this session: todos 1 deadlines 0
>>> What can I do for you?

done 3
>>> Congrats on completing a task! :-)
>>> What can I do for you?

progress
>>> Progress for this session: todos 1 deadlines 1
>>> What can I do for you?

pending 2
>>> OK, I have marked that item as pending
>>> What can I do for you?

progress
>>> Progress for this session: todos 0 deadlines 1
>>> What can I do for you?

list
>>> Here is the list of tasks:
    ============================================================
    STATUS | INDEX | DESCRIPTION                 | DEADLINE
    ------------------------------------------------------------
      âœ“    |   1   | borrow book                 | -
      âœ—    |   2   | read book                   | -
      âœ“    |   3   | return book                 | Monday
    ------------------------------------------------------------
>>> What can I do for you?
```
## Monty 11
Enhance the **Monty 10 code* to make the `Deadline` class inherit from the `ToDo` class:

## Monty 12
Enhance the **Monty 11 code** to divide the source code into multiple files (e.g., `todo.py`, `deadline.py`, etc.).

## Monty 13
Add some **unit tests** to **Monty 12 code.**

## Monty 14
Enhance the **Monty 13 code** to integrate it with the **skeletal GUI** given below.

Notes about the given version of the GUI:

* The GUI shows the list of tasks all the time.
* It initializes with some dummy data.
* It only supports an add command and a help command.

Here are some screenshots of the GUI:
```python
